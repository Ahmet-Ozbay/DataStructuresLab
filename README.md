# Data Structures Laboratory
** What is this? **
This repo contains all the homework tasks I was given for Data Structures Laboratory class during the semester.  

** 1. Recursive Algorithms **
A program that takes a text file containing the snapshot of a set of objects called blobs & computes the number of pixels and center of mass for each blob on the screen.

** 2. Polynomial with Linked Lists **
A program that implements polynomials using linked-list data structure.

** 3. Expression Evaluator **
A program that takes an infix expression, converts it to a postfix expression and then evaluates the expression using stack data structure.

** 4. Deque **
An implementation of Deque data structure using doubly-linked-list.

** 5. Threaded Binary Search Tree **
An implementation of Threaded Binary Search Tree.

** 6. Frequency Counter **
A program that counts the frequencies of the words in the given text file, using map data structure.
